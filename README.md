# Eclipse zenoh Go API

[Eclipse zenoh](http://zenoh.io) is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant [Named Data Networking](http://named-data.net) (NDN) protocol 
that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks. 

:warning: **zenoh has been subjet to a complete rewrite with major protocol updates between versions 0.4.2 and 0.5.0. The Go API does not yet integrate those changes and is only compatible with version 0.4.2 of the zenoh daemon and the underlying zenoh-c stack.**

The Go API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily tested against a zenoh router running in a Docker container (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it). 

-------------------------------
## How to install it

The zenoh-go library relies on the zenoh-c library. Please install it, either [installing the **libzenohc-dev** package](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-c#how-to-install-it), either [building zenoh-c](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-c#how-to-build-it) by yourself

Supported Go version: **1.14.0** minimum.

Install the zenoh-go library via the usual `go get`command:
  ```bash
  $ go get github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-go
  ```

-------------------------------
## Running the Examples

The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the **zenoh** network router (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it) and then to run the examples on your machine.

Then, run the zenoh-go examples following the instructions in [examples/zenoh/README.md](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-go/blob/master/examples/zenoh/README.md)
